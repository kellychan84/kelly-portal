# 市场洞察 Market Insights — how the feed is written

Since 2026-10-02 the **Market Insights page (`insights.html`) is the only place for news** — no separate brief pages.
Each morning / afternoon / weekend update adds ONE file: `insights/data/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<morning|afternoon|weekend>.json`
(a JSON array). Then run `python3 tools/build_index.py` (cloud) or `tools\build-index.ps1` (Windows) to rebuild
`insights/insights.js`. The Python build also checks every card and prints a WARNING for anything that breaks these rules.

The array holds:
1. one **今日速览 snapshot** (`"kind": "summary"`) — first item;
2. one **news card per story** — morning/weekend 4–8, afternoon 3–6.

## Source rules (non-negotiable)
- Whitelist sources only (see `automation/brief-rules.md` 第一步); never Bloomberg, Axios or NPR.
- Every number, fact and quote must come from a page you fetched or a search result you saw **in this run**.
- `source.url` / `sources[].url` must be that exact URL. Never invent, alter or recall URLs from memory.
- **Never make a card about missing data** ("no update", "暂无更新", "could not verify"), and don't mention gaps inside a card
  (Kelly, 2026-10-01). If a region or topic has nothing verified, leave it out.

## The four 🎯 boxes (Kelly's decision, 2026-10-02)
Every news card has all four, in zh and en, written for **that** story (no copy-paste between cards):

| key    | heading on the site                    | what to write |
|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| `dda`  | 📈 长期投资与DDA · Long-term investing & DDA | what this story means for long-term investors and regular (DDA) investing |
| `prs`  | 🌱 退休规划与PRS · Retirement & PRS       | retirement-planning angle; may mention the PRS tax relief of up to RM3,000 a year |
| `lump` | 💰 Lump Sum 单笔投资 · Lump sum            | principles only: phasing in to spread timing risk, checking concentration, matching goals and risk tolerance |
| `bond` | 🏦 债券基金 · Bond funds                  | how the news may affect **Malaysian bond funds** (MGS / corporate bonds and sukuk): interest rates and Bank Negara's OPR, inflation, ringgit and foreign flows, credit. If there is little direct effect, say so briefly and explain bonds' role as a portfolio balancer |

- Start each box straight with the content. **Do not repeat the heading** ("🎯 DDA定期定额:…") — the site already shows it.
- General education only: **no allocation percentages**, no "split into N tranches", no buy/sell calls on named funds or
  stocks, no promissory or absolute words (保证 / 稳赚 / 必涨 / 牢不可破 / 封死下行空间 / 无风险 / guaranteed / can't lose /
  unshakeable / risk-free). Use "may / usually / generally" (可能 / 通常 / 一般).

## Writing rules
- Analysis (💡): 2–4 sentences — what happened (with the verified numbers), why it matters; one everyday analogy is welcome.
- Bilingual: every text field has `zh` and `en`. Tone: Kelly's warm-professional voice; say 信托基金顾问 / 信托基金.
